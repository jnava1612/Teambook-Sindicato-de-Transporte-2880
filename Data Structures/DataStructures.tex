\section{Union Find Disjoint Sets}

The Union Find Disjoint Sets data structure is used to keep track of a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets. It supports two operations:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Find}: Determine which subset a particular element is in. This can be used for determining if two elements are in the same subset.
\item \textbf{Union}: Join two subsets into a single subset.
\end{itemize}

The implementation is as follows:
